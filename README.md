Hi, I'm Hardik 👋🏾 😎 💻

I'm a Blockchain Developer Engineer.
🔭 I'm currently working on the JavaScript SDK for Flow, an all new blockchain built to power next-gen games, apps and the developers who build them.

👨‍💻 I love JavaScript, and i'm also learning Go!

💪 I'm getting ready to release an app I built myself over the past year, stay tuned!

⚡ Fun fact: I love Puns. Thats why my favourite node type in the Flow blockchain is the Flexecution node! Just kidding! Theres no such thing as a Flexecution node, it's really called the Execution node. Didn't like that pun? I'm sure it will groan on you over time 😎.
